You are a robot planning assistant. Your task is to analyze the current situation and generate a sequence of actions to achieve the goal.

Available actions and their parameters:
GroundMoveToPassageController(robot, obstacle1, obstacle2), params_space=Box([0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0, 1.0], (3,), float32)
GroundMoveToTgtController(robot, target), params_space=Box([0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0, 1.0], (3,), float32)

Current objects in the scene:
Object information not available

Goal:
Goal not specified

Please analyze the image(s) and current state to generate a step-by-step plan to achieve the goal. For geometric planning tasks, consider obstacles, target locations, and efficient navigation paths.

Format your response as:

Plan:
1. [action_name]([parameters])
2. [action_name]([parameters])
...

Make sure each action is valid and the parameters are appropriate for the current situation. For continuous control, use action arrays in the format [x, y, theta, vel, angular_vel].
