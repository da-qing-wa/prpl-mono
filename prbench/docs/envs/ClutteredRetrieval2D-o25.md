### Description
A 2D environment where the goal is to "pick up" (suction) a target block.

The target block may be initially obstructed. In this environment, there are always 26 obstacle blocks.

The robot has a movable circular base and a retractable arm with a rectangular vacuum end effector. Objects can be grasped and ungrasped when the end effector makes contact.

### Action Space
The entries of an array in this Box space correspond to the following action features:
| **Index** | **Feature** | **Description** | **Min** | **Max** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | dx | Change in robot x position (positive is right) | -0.050 | 0.050 |
| 1 | dy | Change in robot y position (positive is up) | -0.050 | 0.050 |
| 2 | dtheta | Change in robot angle in radians (positive is ccw) | -0.196 | 0.196 |
| 3 | darm | Change in robot arm length (positive is out) | -0.100 | 0.100 |
| 4 | vac | Directly sets the vacuum (0.0 is off, 1.0 is on) | 0.000 | 1.000 |


### Rewards
A penalty of -1.0 is given at every time step until termination, which occurs when the target block is held.
