### Description
A 3D mobile manipulation environment using the TidyBot platform.

The robot has a holonomic mobile base with powered casters and a Kinova Gen3 arm.
Scene type: cupboard with 8 objects.

The robot can control:
- Base pose (x, y, theta)
- Arm position (x, y, z)
- Arm orientation (quaternion)
- Gripper position (open/close)

### Initial State Distribution

### Observation Space
The entries of an array in this Box space correspond to the following object features:
| **Index** | **Object** | **Feature** |
| --- | --- | --- |


### Action Space
Actions: base_pose (3), arm_pos (3), arm_quat (4), gripper_pos (1)

### Rewards
Reward function depends on the specific task:
- Object stacking: Reward for successfully stacking objects
- Drawer/cabinet tasks: Reward for opening/closing and placing objects
- General manipulation: Reward for successful pick-and-place operations

Currently returns a small negative reward (-0.01) per timestep to encourage exploration.
