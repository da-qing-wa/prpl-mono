### Description
A 3D mobile manipulation environment using the TidyBot platform.

The robot has a holonomic mobile base with powered casters and a Kinova Gen3 arm.
Scene type: ground with 1 objects. In the 'ground' scene, objects are placed randomly on a flat ground plane.

The robot can control:
- Base pose (x, y, theta)
- Arm position (x, y, z)
- Arm orientation (quaternion)
- Gripper position (open/close)

### Action Space
Actions: base pos and yaw (3), arm joints (7), gripper pos (1)

### Rewards
The primary reward is for successfully placing objects at their target locations.
- A reward of +1.0 is given for each object placed within a 5cm tolerance of its target.
- A smaller positive reward is given for objects within a 10cm tolerance to guide the robot.
- A small negative reward (-0.01) is applied at each timestep to encourage efficiency.
The episode terminates when all objects are placed at their respective targets.
